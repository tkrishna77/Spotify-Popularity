# Spotify-Popularity
Script to pull meta and track-feature data from large Spotify playlist containing popular/impactful songs released over time. 

Idea is to run the script daily and then eventually measure the change in popularity over 2 weeks post-release, and then popularity at one-month post-release.

Once enough data is collected, I'll attempt to pass songs that have been out for only two weeks into a model to get a sense of where they will end up a month after their release date.
